#TechniqueName: Rootkit
#AtomicTestName: Windows Signed Driver Rootkit Test
#Description: This test exploits a signed driver to execute code in Kernel.&This example was curated from a blog that utilizes puppetstrings.exe with the vulnerable (signed driver) capcom.sys. &The capcom.sys driver may be found on github. A great reference is here: http://www.fuzzysecurity.com/tutorials/28.html&SHA1 C1D5CF8C43E7679B782630E93F5E6420CA1749A7&We leverage the work done here:&https://zerosum0x0.blogspot.com/2017/07/puppet-strings-dirty-secret-for-free.html&The hash of our PoC Exploit is&SHA1 DD8DA630C00953B6D5182AA66AF999B1E117F441&This will simulate hiding a process.&
