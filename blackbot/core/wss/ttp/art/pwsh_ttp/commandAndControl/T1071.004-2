#TechniqueName: Application Layer Protocol: DNS
#AtomicTestName: DNS Regular Beaconing
#Description: This test simulates an infected host beaconing via DNS queries to a command and control server at regular intervals over time.&This behaviour is typical of implants either in an idle state waiting for instructions or configured to use a low query volume over time to evade threshold based detection.&A custom domain and sub-domain will need to be passed as input parameters for this test to work. Upon execution, DNS information about the domain will be displayed for each callout.&
