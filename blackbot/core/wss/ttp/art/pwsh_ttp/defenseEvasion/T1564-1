#TechniqueName: Hide Artifacts
#AtomicTestName: Extract binary files via VBA
#Description: This module extracts a binary (calc.exe) from inside of another binary. &&In the wild maldoc authors will use this technique to hide binaries inside of files stored &within the office document itself. An example of this technique can be seen in sample&&f986040c7dd75b012e7dfd876acb33a158abf651033563ab068800f07f508226&&This sample contains a document inside of itself. Document 1 is the actual maldoc itself, document 2&is the same document without all the malicious code. Document 1 will copy Document 2 to the file system&and then "peek" inside of this document and pull out the oleObject.bin file. Contained inside of this&oleObject.bin file is a payload that is parsed out and executed on the file system.&
