#TechniqueName: System Network Configuration Discovery
#AtomicTestName: List Open Egress Ports
#Description: This is to test for what ports are open outbound.  The technique used was taken from the following blog:&https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/poking-holes-in-the-firewall-egress-testing-with-allports-exposed/&&Upon successful execution, powershell will read top-128.txt (ports) and contact each port to confirm if open or not. Output will be to Desktop\open-ports.txt.&
