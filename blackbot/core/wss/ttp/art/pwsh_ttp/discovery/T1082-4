#AtomicTestName: Griffon Recon
#Description: Griffon is a sophisticated tool believed to be in use by one of more "APT" groups.  This atomic is for detecting, specifically, the reconnaissance part of the tool.&This script used here was reduced by security researcher Kirk Sayre (github.com/kirk-sayre-work/1a9476e7708ed650508f9fb5adfbad9d), &and it gives the exact same recon behavior as the original (minus the C2 interaction).  &For more information see also e.g. https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/js.griffon and https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0417/
