#TechniqueName: Hijack Execution Flow: Path Interception by Unquoted Path
#AtomicTestName: Execution of program.exe as service with unquoted service path
#Description: When a service is created whose executable path contains spaces and isnâ€™t enclosed within quotes, leads to a vulnerability&known as Unquoted Service Path which allows a user to gain SYSTEM privileges.&In this case, if an executable program.exe in C:\ exists, C:\program.exe will be executed instead of test.exe in C:\Program Files\subfolder\test.exe.&
