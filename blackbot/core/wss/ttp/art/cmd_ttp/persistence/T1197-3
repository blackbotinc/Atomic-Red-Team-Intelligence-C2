#TechniqueName: BITS Jobs
#AtomicTestName: Persist, Download, & Execute
#Description: This test simulates an adversary leveraging bitsadmin.exe to schedule a BITS transferand execute a payload in multiple steps.&Note that in this test, the file executed is not the one downloaded. The downloading of a random file is simply the trigger for getting bitsdamin to run an executable.&This has the interesting side effect of causing the executable (e.g. notepad) to run with an Initiating Process of "svchost.exe" and an Initiating Process Command Line of "svchost.exe -k netsvcs -p -s BITS"&This job will remain in the BITS queue until complete or for up to 90 days by default if not removed.&
